Interacting Multiple Model Kalman Filters for Pulse Repetition Interval Value Estimation and Modulation Recognition in Electromagnetic Warfare Systems
----------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Accurate estimation of radar parameters such as the Pulse Repetition Interval (PRI) is a critical prerequisite for effective Electromagnetic Warfare (EW) operations, particularly in deception techniques such as Range Gate Pull-In (RGPI) and false-target generation. Within the broader EW process—which includes searching, detection, localization, identification, and surveillance of radar emitters—timely PRI characterization is central to Electromagnetic Support Measures (ESM). In this study, a parallel Kalman filtering approach is proposed to identify and track both the modulation type and time-varying characteristics of PRI sequences observed by an ESM receiver. The method incorporates a bank of Kalman filters, each designed to model a specific PRI modulation pattern—such as constant, staggered, jittered, sliding, wobulated, dwell and switch types. Through an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) framework, the algorithm dynamically estimates the most likely modulation type and its parameters even under noisy and incomplete pulse observations. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach provides robust and accurate PRI estimation across diverse signal environments. These capabilities are essential for advanced EW deception techniques that require precise pulse-timing knowledge. The framework offers strong potential for integration into real-time EW systems, contributing to enhanced radar countermeasure effectiveness and survivability in contested electromagnetic environments.
